Code Review
The code being reviewed is the code for task 5 written by Adrian, which determines whether a placement sequence is valid.
A unique feature of this code, was that the problem was separated into the layers of the board; board, upboard and bottom board seen in line 121-123.
An array is initiated, and given occupied values. 
I feel that the code structure is the best feature, as it is easy to understand and read.

The code written is well documented, with appropriate comments that explain different lines of code (as seen in line 150, 155 etc). 
This aids to the understanding of the code written, as well as the debugging process.

The class and method structures are appropriate, with suitable constructors.

The methods and variables are properly named for ease of comprehension (position, shape and index in line 141, 146 and 156 describe exactly what they are). 
This style of naming is kept consistent throughout the code.

I have not spotted any errors in the code, or any means of improvement. The code passes all the junit tasks provided.
