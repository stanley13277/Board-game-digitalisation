We declare that the work we have submitted for Stage G of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely our own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* **TASK 4**The idea of doing Task4 is come from Zhang Jun(u6122372), specifically drawboard and draw method (Yen-WEi, LI)
* **TASK 4**The idea of using SubString is come from [HERE](http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/java/substring.html).(Yen-WEi, LI)

* **TASK 5** the idea for judging whether the Placement sequence is valid by using the char '.' is from the method
in the task6 in assignment1 in this course.
* **Task6** The method testTrue that return boolean was defined in task 6 to judge whether the next piece placement is viable.
JIALE WANG (u6127777) gave me the entire idea of this method(testTrue) that use recursion and task 5 to judge next piece placement to solve the problem.
* **Task9** The idea of using recursion to get solution and eliminate already used location is from YiLun Hou(u6147476)(noted in source code comments).
* The function implementation and idea that play music and quit the platform in the game is from class game in the assignment 1 in this course.
