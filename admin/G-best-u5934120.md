I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The best part of the code is task 10 and the added logic for constraints in task7.

The best part of the task7 is the logic to add the constraints on the pieces. When the pieces are covered by other pieces
it can not be dragged and it can not be placed into the already occupied location in the board. The
board state is used to judge this. For each operation, the board state are updated. Also, the method that snap into the board
is not the nearest distance. The coordinates are found and placed into the nearest by using rounding number.

For task10, the best part is giving the hits. For each starting placement, to make sure the game run faster, the all ordered solution
are given. The placement will judge whether there is a solution, if not, the information will be shown in the window to guide the user
to finish this game. Also, sometimes, the given hit might be more than one.


I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of doing task9 came from a discussion with YiLun Hou (u6147476).
